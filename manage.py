BEFORE THE APP STARTS

NginX runs on the server - virtual server hosted by digital ocean
Gunicorn serves as the an alternative gateway between server and app?
wsgi handles incoming requests instead of us using runserver 
this file launches our app (in development we can use runserver)

Digital Ocean --(hosts)--> NginX ---(gateway)--> wsgi --(requests)---> Flask app
